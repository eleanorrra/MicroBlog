# MicroBlog

Microblog is a web application that allows users to create password-protected accounts, subscribe to other users, and post messages. This project is based on the concept of microblogging, making it an analogue of Twitter.

The following technologies were used in the development of the project:
---
``` bash
Python
Flask #a web framework for creating web applications in Python
HTML, CSS #used to create a user interface and interact with the user
Bootstrap #providing ready-made templates and components for creating user-friendly interfaces
SQLite #for data storage
SQLAlchemy #for interactions with the database in the application
```
To implement the functionality of the microblog, various functions were used, such as user authentication, creating new posts, and following other users."
